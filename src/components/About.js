    I am a student who has gained a solid foundation in web development through my studies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am comfortable creating web pages from scratch using semantic HTML markup, styling them with CSS to achieve the desired look and layout, and adding interactivity and functionality with JavaScript. I understand the core concepts of each language, how they work together, and best practices for structuring code. While I still have more to learn, I feel confident in my ability to build simple websites and web applications. I enjoy the creative process of designing interfaces and the problem-solving aspect of making things work with code. My goal is to continue expanding my skills to become a professional web developer.
